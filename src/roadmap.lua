notes with matt

- cs505 algorithm
- hpothesis, geenerate random data has tha the feature of interest

- strucutres
  1. business vieww: (fromhttp://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/2019-481F/readings/infose.pdf:#page=9
     - When = past, present, future
     - What = explore, analyze, experiment
     - How = Explanation
     - Who = Goals
  2. systems view. y=f(x): 
     - build f with limited access to y (aka semi-supervised learning)
     - y can be symbolic or numeric
     - y can be single or multi goal (and if the latter, then there are weights)

divide (sort, clster)
split numeris
merge
contrast

explore past = trends = sort by time, divide, discretize, contrast
analsize past = summarize =  constrast b^2/(a+b)
experiment past = model = cluster, descrecirze contrast "max a" or "max b"

explore present= cluster, index, outliers 1/(a+b)
analuze present: asscoaition. what ahppens here but not there b^2/(a+b)
anaylze present: sort by normalized b, sort by normalized a

future forecast: b^2/(b+a)
anaysize goals: planning it + b -a
experiment fugure: comptuer a,b

planning, optimize, monitor, tabu

problem-oriented
- what is the problem? exploring the world
- pile of data representing thw reold explore the rod
- unfold details.
  - lua 101
    - cli
    - printing objects
    - test cases
  - lua objects 101

- student projects: code in in python, typescript, rust

- biclustering. code that is shown ad code that is runable

- divide into byte size chunks

- business needs

- ethics , explanations

- i can see a programming 

hey too many knobs, too many options. people use too few. and 30% errors on config


hwy pythin: environment hell

deer in the spotlight. ai being out of control

- nB
- KNN
- decision tree
- MOEA deonstrat
